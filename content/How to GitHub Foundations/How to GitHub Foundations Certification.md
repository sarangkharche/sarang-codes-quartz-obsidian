# Introduction

I have challenged myself to take prepare and take the GitHub Foundations exam in 36 hours! (Not that I don't have other things to do haha)

But let's get in to it:

- Step 1 - Book the exam to motivate yourself to study.
- Step 2 - Write a blog to procrastinate.
- Step 3 - Read the study [guide](https://assets.ctfassets.net/wfutmusr1t3h/1kmMx7AwI4qH8yIZgOmQlP/79e6ff1dfdee589d84a24dd763b1eef7/github-foundations-exam-study-guide__1_.pdf)
- Step 4 - Learning Path [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/o1njfe825p602p)
- Step 5 - YouTube Tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdc0i7RcBv8&t=30038s)

# Theory of operation

Create an architecture diagram describing the proposed solution

Spell Out the Details of the proposed architecture

- ::component 1:: does X
- which impacts ::component 2::
- ::component 3:: does Y
- ::component4:: finishes work off
